# Property Index Integration with Query Engine - Status

## Overview

The property index structure for efficiently finding nodes and edges based on their property values has been implemented. This document describes the current state of integration between this index and the query engine.

## Current Status

The property index and query engine integration is **partially implemented**:

✅ **Implemented**:
- The property index structure is fully implemented in `pkg/storage/property_index.go`
- Query parsing for `FIND_NODES_BY_PROPERTY` and `FIND_EDGES_BY_PROPERTY` is implemented
- The query optimizer recognizes and can optimize these query types
- The query types are defined and documented in the code

❌ **Not Yet Implemented**:
- The actual execution functions `executeNodesByProperty` and `executeEdgesByProperty` are not yet implemented
- The query engine can parse but not fully execute property-based queries

## Query Syntax

The query parsing supports the following syntax (which will work once execution is implemented):

```
FIND_NODES_BY_PROPERTY(propertyName: "name", propertyValue: "Alice")
FIND_EDGES_BY_PROPERTY(propertyName: "role", propertyValue: "Developer")
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Short Term (Immediate Next Steps)**:
   - Implement the missing `executeNodesByProperty` function
   - Implement the missing `executeEdgesByProperty` function
   - Connect these to the existing property index structures
   - Add unit tests for property-based queries

2. **Medium Term**:
   - Optimize query execution to efficiently use the property index
   - Add support for range queries on numeric properties
   - Implement property-based filtering within other query types

3. **Long Term**:
   - Add full-text search capabilities for string properties
   - Support for property value indexing with specialized data structures
   - Collection of statistics for query optimization

## Implementation Notes

- The underlying property index is fully implemented as a specialized SSTable format
- The index follows an LSM-tree based structure consistent with the architecture
- The query parsing module is ready to support these queries
- Execution functions need to be implemented to complete the integration

## Using Property Index Directly

While the query integration is incomplete, applications can directly use the property index through the storage engine API:

```go
// Example of direct property index usage (without query integration)
nodePropertyIdx, _ := storage.GetIndex(storage.IndexTypePropertyValue)
key := []byte("name|Alice")  // Format: propertyName|propertyValue
nodeIDs, _ := nodePropertyIdx.Get(key)
```

This provides a workaround until the full query integration is complete.
