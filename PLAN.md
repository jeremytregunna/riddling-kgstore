## Knowledge Graph Backup & Query Format: "KGStore" - A Plan for Efficiency, Reliability & Query Performance

Given the priority of performance and reliability, and drawing inspiration from SQLite, here's a plan for "KGStore", a file format designed for backing and querying knowledge graphs.  It's a layered approach, focusing on minimizing disk I/O, maximizing data locality, and enabling efficient indexing.

**I. Core Principles & Lessons from SQLite:**

* **Single File:** Like SQLite, KGStore will be a single file. This simplifies backups, portability, and eliminates the overhead of managing multiple files.
* **B-Tree Indexing:**  The core of performance will be B-Tree indexing, heavily inspired by SQLite.  We'll use multiple B-Trees for different query patterns.
* **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):**  Crucial for reliability.  All changes are written to a WAL file before being applied to the main database file. This ensures atomicity and durability, even in case of crashes.
* **Page-Based Storage:**  Data will be stored in fixed-size pages (e.g., 4KB or 8KB). This simplifies memory management and disk I/O.
* **Data Locality:**  Related data (nodes and edges connected to them) should be stored close together on disk to reduce seek times.
* **Schema Flexibility:**  While a schema will be defined, the format should allow for schema evolution and property addition without requiring a complete rewrite of the database.
* **Compression:**  Employ compression techniques to reduce storage space and potentially improve I/O performance (at the cost of CPU).



**II. Architecture & Data Organization**

KGStore will be structured around several key components, stored within the single file:

1. **Header:** (Small, fixed size)
   *  File Format Version
   *  Page Size
   *  Root Page IDs for:
      * Node Index
      * Edge Index
      * Property Index
      * WAL File ID
   *  Schema Information (versioned)

2. **Node Index:** (B-Tree)
   * **Key:** Node ID (Unique identifier for each node)
   * **Value:**  Page ID pointing to the Node Data Page.
   * **Purpose:**  Fast lookup of nodes by ID.

3. **Edge Index:** (B-Tree)
   * **Key:**  (Source Node ID, Edge Type, Destination Node ID) -  This is a composite key for efficient relationship lookup.
   * **Value:** Page ID pointing to the Edge Data Page.
   * **Purpose:** Fast lookup of edges between nodes.  This is the most crucial index for graph traversal.

4. **Property Index:** (B-Tree)
   * **Key:** (Entity ID, Property Name) â€“  Entity ID can be Node ID or Edge ID.
   * **Value:** Page ID pointing to the Property Data Page.
   * **Purpose:** Fast lookup of properties for a given entity.

5. **Node Data Pages:**
   *  Variable-length records representing nodes.  Each record will include:
      * Node ID (redundant, but helpful)
      * Node Type (e.g., Person, Organization, Location)
      * List of Property IDs (pointers to Property Data Pages)
      *  Potentially, a list of adjacent Node IDs for fast neighborhood queries.

6. **Edge Data Pages:**
   * Variable-length records representing edges. Each record will include:
      * Source Node ID
      * Destination Node ID
      * Edge Type
      * List of Property IDs (pointers to Property Data Pages)

7. **Property Data Pages:**
   * Variable-length records representing properties. Each record will include:
      * Property Name
      * Property Value (string, number, boolean, date, etc.)
      * Data Type

8. **Write-Ahead Log (WAL) File:**
    *  Stores all changes before they are written to the main database file.  This is a separate file that is periodically "checkpointed" into the main file.

**III. Data Serialization & Compression**

* **Variable-Length Records:** Use a length-prefixed format for variable-length data (strings, property values). This allows for efficient parsing.
* **Delta Encoding:** For Node IDs, Property IDs, and other sequential identifiers, use delta encoding to reduce storage space. Store the first ID as is, and subsequent IDs as the difference from the previous one.
* **Compression:**
    * **Page-Level Compression:** Compress entire pages using a library like Zstandard (Zstd) or LZ4. This provides a good balance between compression ratio and speed.
    * **Property Value Compression:** Compress frequently occurring strings or large text values within property records.

**IV. Querying & Optimization**

* **Query Language:**  A SPARQL-like query language would be ideal for KGStore, but a simpler, custom query language optimized for the data structure is also viable.
* **Query Planner:**  A query planner will analyze queries and determine the most efficient way to access the data.
* **Index Selection:** The query planner will choose the appropriate index (Node Index, Edge Index, Property Index) based on the query predicates.
* **Graph Traversal Optimization:**
    * **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed nodes and edges in memory.
    * **Parallel Traversal:**  Utilize multiple threads to traverse the graph in parallel.
    * **Bloom Filters:** Use Bloom filters to quickly determine if an edge exists between two nodes.

**V. Reliability & Concurrency**

* **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):**  As mentioned, WAL is crucial for ensuring data durability and atomicity.
* **Checkpointing:** Periodically checkpoint the WAL file into the main database file to reduce recovery time.
* **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC):**  Implement MVCC to allow multiple readers and writers to access the database concurrently without blocking each other.
* **Data Validation:**  Perform data validation checks to ensure data integrity.



**VI. Technology Choices**

* **Programming Language:** Go is an excellent choice.
* **Serialization Library:** encoding/binary is suitable for the need.
* **Compression Library:** Zstandard (Zstd) or LZ4.
* **B-Tree Implementation:**  A high-performance B-Tree library or a custom implementation.

**VII. Future Considerations**

* **Distributed Storage:**  Extend the architecture to support distributed storage across multiple machines.
* **Spatial Indexing:** Add spatial indexing for location-based queries.
* **Temporal Data:**  Support temporal data for tracking changes over time.




**Conclusion:**

KGStore is a robust and efficient file format for backing and querying knowledge graphs. By leveraging lessons from SQLite, focusing on data locality, and employing advanced compression and indexing techniques, it can deliver high performance, reliability, and scalability. This plan provides a solid foundation for building a powerful and versatile knowledge graph storage solution.
