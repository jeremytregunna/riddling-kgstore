## KGStore Action Plan - Phased Development

Here's a phased action plan for developing KGStore, building upon previous work and enabling a smooth transition between phases.  Each phase will have specific deliverables and acceptance criteria.  Estimated timelines are provided, but will depend on team size and resources.

**Overall Timeline Estimate: 12-18 months**



**Phase 1: Core Data Structures & Serialization (2-3 months)**

* **Goal:** Establish the foundational data structures and serialization mechanisms.  Focus on correctness and basic performance.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **Data Structure Definitions:**  Complete definitions for Node, Edge, Property, and Page structures in chosen programming language (Go).
    * **Serialization/Deserialization Library:** Implement a library to serialize and deserialize these structures to/from a byte stream.  encoding/binary should be used to encode in the file.
    * **Basic Page Management:** Implement a simple page allocator and deallocator.
    * **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests for all data structures and serialization/deserialization code.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *  Serialization/Deserialization is correct and efficient.
    *  Page allocation/deallocation works as expected.
    *  All unit tests pass with 100% coverage.
* **Dependencies:** None. This is the starting point.
* **Flow to Phase 2:**  Provides the necessary building blocks for creating the B-Tree index and file format.



**Phase 2: B-Tree Index & File Format Implementation (3-4 months)**

* **Goal:** Implement the B-Tree index and the core file format structure.  Focus on correctness and basic indexing performance.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **B-Tree Implementation:** Implement a generic B-Tree data structure with configurable node size and degree.
    * **Key/Value Storage:** Adapt the B-Tree to store Node/Edge/Property IDs as keys and serialized data as values.
    * **File Format Definition:** Define the file format structure (header, page allocation table, data pages).
    * **Basic File Writer/Reader:** Implement a basic file writer and reader to create and read KGStore files.
    * **Integration Tests:** Integration tests to verify that data can be inserted, read, and deleted using the B-Tree index and file format.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *  B-Tree index works correctly for insertion, deletion, and search.
    *  File format is correctly written and read.
    *  Integration tests pass with 100% coverage.
* **Dependencies:** Phase 1 deliverables.
* **Flow to Phase 3:** Provides the foundational storage and indexing engine for the next phase.



**Phase 3: Data Loading, Querying & Basic Optimization (3-4 months)**

* **Goal:** Implement data loading, a basic query engine, and initial performance optimizations.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **Data Loader:** Implement a data loader to import data from a common format (e.g., CSV, JSON, Turtle) into KGStore.
    * **Query Parser:** Implement a simple query parser to translate basic queries into execution plans. (Start with a subset of SPARQL or a custom query language).
    * **Query Executor:** Implement a query executor to execute query plans and retrieve data from the B-Tree index.
    * **Basic Query Optimization:** Implement basic query optimization techniques (e.g., index selection, constant folding).
    * **Performance Benchmarks:** Establish performance benchmarks to measure query execution time and throughput.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *  Data can be loaded into KGStore correctly.
    *  Basic queries can be executed and return correct results.
    *  Performance benchmarks meet minimum acceptable thresholds.
* **Dependencies:** Phase 2 deliverables.
* **Flow to Phase 4:** Provides a functional query engine and a foundation for more advanced optimization.



**Phase 4: Advanced Optimization & Concurrency (2-3 months)**

* **Goal:** Implement advanced optimization techniques and concurrency control to improve performance and scalability.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **Advanced Query Optimization:** Implement advanced query optimization techniques (e.g., join reordering, predicate pushdown).
    * **Caching Layer:** Implement a caching layer to store frequently accessed data in memory.
    * **Concurrency Control:** Implement MVCC or another concurrency control mechanism to allow multiple readers and writers to access the database concurrently.
    * **Performance Tuning:** Tune the database configuration to optimize performance for different workloads.
    * **Stress Testing:** Perform stress testing to verify the database’s stability and scalability under heavy load.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *  Advanced optimization techniques significantly improve query performance.
    *  Caching layer reduces query latency.
    *  Concurrency control ensures data consistency and prevents deadlocks.
    *  Stress tests demonstrate the database’s stability and scalability.
* **Dependencies:** Phase 3 deliverables.
* **Flow to Phase 5:** Provides a production-ready database engine.



**Phase 5:  Refinement, Documentation & Deployment (1-2 months)**

* **Goal:** Refine the database engine, create comprehensive documentation, and prepare for deployment.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **Code Refactoring:** Refactor the codebase to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
    * **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation for developers and users.
    * **Deployment Scripts:** Create deployment scripts to automate the deployment process.
    * **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting to track database health and performance.
    * **Final Testing & QA:** Perform final testing and QA to ensure the database meets all requirements.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *  Codebase is clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain.
    *  Documentation is comprehensive and accurate.
    *  Deployment process is automated and reliable.
    *  Monitoring and alerting are configured correctly.
    *  Final testing and QA pass with no critical defects.




**Important Considerations:**

* **Agile Methodology:**  Use an agile development methodology with short sprints and frequent releases.
* **Version Control:**  Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively.
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):**  Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
* **Regular Code Reviews:**  Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and prevent bugs.
* **Performance Profiling:**  Use performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.
